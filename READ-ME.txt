To send the form data to the database, you need to handle the form submission using PHP and MySQL. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a database and table**:
    First, create a database and a table to store the bursary application data.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE bursary_fund;

    USE bursary_fund;

    CREATE TABLE applications (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
         dob DATE NOT NULL,
         gender ENUM('male', 'female') NOT NULL,
         education_level VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         institution VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         amount_requested DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
         national_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         death_certificate VARCHAR(255),
         bank_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         branch VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         account_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         account_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         application_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

2. **Update the form to include `enctype` for file uploads**:
    Update the form tag to include `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.

    ```html
    <form id="application-form" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST" action="submit_application.php">
    ```

3. **Create a PHP script to handle the form submission**:
    Create a file named `submit_application.php` to handle the form submission and save the data to the database.

    ```php



    4. **Update the form action**:
    Update the form action in your HTML to point to `submit_application.php`.

    ```html
    <form id="application-form" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST" action="submit_application.php">
    ```

Now, when the form is submitted, the data will be sent to `submit_application.php`, which will handle the database insertion. Make sure to create a directory named `uploads` in your project root to store the uploaded files.
